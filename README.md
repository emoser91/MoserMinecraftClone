# MoserMinecraftClone
First attempt at a Minecraft Clone in C++ using OpenGL

# Decription
  This is a current work in progress project to extend my knowledge of C++ and the fundamentals of graphics generation.
  It currently can generate any .obj file based object or manually based on vertices, apply textures and lighting to objects, allow for       keyboard and mouse input to translate a camera and a few other goodies such as a game timer and player crosshairs
  
# What is left to implement
  Make the player crosshairs static
  
  Mass block generation algorithm
  
  Skybox to give it that game feel 
  
  Break/Add block and storage
  
  Physics such as walking on top block and jumping

# Dependencies
 You will need GLEW(OpenGL 3.3 or newer), GLM and SLD2 libraries and a complier that supports C++
 
# Screenshots
To be added once I have more then just a few blocks generated and skybox implemented
